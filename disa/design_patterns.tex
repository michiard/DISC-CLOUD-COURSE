%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The problem: building word co-occurrence matrices for large corpora}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The co-occurrence matrix of a corpus is a square $n \times n$ matrix, $M$
    \item $n$ is the number of unique words (\textit{i.e.}, the vocabulary size)
    \item A cell $m_{ij}$ contains the number of times the word $w_i$ co-occurs with word $w_j$ \textit{within a specific context}
    \item Context: a sentence, a paragraph a document or a window of $m$ words
    \item NOTE: the matrix may be symmetric in some cases
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{Motivation}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item This problem is a basic building block for more complex operations
    \item {\color{red}Estimating the distribution of discrete joint events from a large number of observations}
    \item Similar problem in other domains:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Customers who buy \textit{this} tend to also buy
        \textit{that}
      \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame {\frametitle{Observations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Space requirements}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Clearly, the space requirement is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the size of the vocabulary
    \item For real-world (English) corpora $n$ can be hundreds of thousands of words, or even billions of worlds in some specific cases
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{So what's the problem?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item If the matrix can fit in the memory of a single machine, then just use whatever naive implementation
    \item Instead, if the matrix is bigger than the available memory, then {\color{red}paging} would kick in, and any naive
      implementation would break
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{Compression}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Such techniques can help in solving the problem on a single machine

  \item \textbf{We must define an appropriate partitioner}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The default partitioner is based on the hash value of the
      intermediate key, modulo the number of reducers
    \item For a complex key, the {\bf raw byte representation} is used to
      compute the hash value
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Hence, there is no guarantee that the pair (dog, aardvark)
        and (dog,zebra) are sent to the same reducer
      \end{itemize}
    \item What we want is that all pairs with the same left word are
      sent to the same reducer
   \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{Limitations of this approach}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Essentially, we reproduce the stripes method in the reducer
      and we need to use a custom partitioner
    \item This algorithm would work, but present the same
      memory-bottleneck problem as the stripes method
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{The key is to properly sequence data presented to
      reducers}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item If it were possible to compute the marginal in the reducer
      before processing the joint counts, the reducer could simply
      divide the joint counts received from mappers by the marginal
    \item The notion of ``before'' and ``after'' can be captured in
      the {\color{red}ordering of key-value pairs}
    \item The programmer can define the sort order of keys so that
      data needed earlier is presented to the reducer before data that
      is needed later

      as keys}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{The mapper:}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item additionally emits a ``special'' key of the form $(w_i,*)$
    \item The value associated to the special key is one, that
      represents the contribution of the word pair to the marginal
    \item Using combiners, these partial marginal counts will be
      aggregated before being sent to the reducers
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{The reducer:}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item We must make sure that the special key-value pairs are
      processed {\color{red}before} any other key-value pairs where
      the left word is $w_i$
    \item We also need to modify the partitioner as before,
      \textit{i.e.}, it would take into account only the first word

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Minimal, because only the marginal (an integer) needs to be
      stored

  \item \textbf{Key ingredients for order inversion}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Emit a special key-value pair to capture the marginal
    \item Control the sort order of the intermediate key, so that the
      special key-value pair is processed first
    \item Define a custom partitioner for routing intermediate
      key-value pairs
    \item Preserve state across multiple keys in the reducer
