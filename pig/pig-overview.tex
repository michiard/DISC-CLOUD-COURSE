  \item \textbf{Manual inspection before batch processing}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Very often engineers look for exploitable trends in their

    \item This is difficult to do in practice, given the sheer size of
      the datasets

      performing \texttt{JOIN} operations

  \item[$\to$] Code is difficult to reuse and maintain
  \item[$\to$] Semantics of the analysis task are obscured
  \item[$\to$] Optimizations are difficult due to opacity of

    \begin{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame {\frametitle{Dataflow Language}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{A Pig Latin program specifies a series of steps}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Each step is a {\color{red}single}, high level data transformation
    \item Stylistically different from SQL
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{With reference to Example 1}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The programmer supply an order in which each operation will be done
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{Consider the following snippet}
  \end{itemize}


\noindent \texttt{spam\_urls = FILTER urls BY isSpam(url);\\
culprit\_urls = FILTER spam\_urls BY pagerank > 0.8;}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame {\frametitle{Dataflow Language}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Data flow optimizations}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Explicit sequences of operations can be overridden
    \item Use of high-level, relational-algebra-style primitives
      (\texttt{GROUP}, \texttt{FILTER},...) allows using traditional
      RDBMS optimization techniques
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item[$\to$] \textbf{NOTE: it is necessary to check whether such
    optimizations are beneficial or not, by hand}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{Pig Latin allows Pig to perform optimizations that would
    otherwise by a tedious manual exercise if done at the MapReduce
    level
}
  \end{itemize}
}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame {\frametitle{Quick Start and Interoperability}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Data I/O is greatly simplified in Pig}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item No need to curate, bulk import, parse, apply schema, create
      indexes that traditional RDBMS require
    \item Standard and ad-hoc ``readers'' and ``writers'' facilitate
      the task of ingesting and producing data in arbitrary formats
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{Pig can work with a wide range of other tools}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{Why RDBMS have stringent requirements?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item To enable transactional consistency guarantees
    \item To enable efficient point lookup (using physical indexes)
    \item To enable data curation on behalf of the user
    \item To enable other users figuring out what the data is, by
      studying the schema
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame {\frametitle{Quick Start and Interoperability}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Why is Pig so flexible?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Supports {\color{red}read-only workloads}
    \item Supports {\color{red}scan-only workloads} (no lookups)
    \item[$\to$] No need for transactions nor indexes
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{Why data curation is not required?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Very often, Pig is used for ad-hoc data analysis
    \item Work on temporary datasets, then throw them out!
    \item[$\to$] Curation is an overkill
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{Schemas are optional}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Can apply one on the fly, at runtime
    \item Can refer to fields using positional notation
    \item E.g.: \texttt{good\_urls = FILTER urls BY \$2 > 0.2}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame {\frametitle{Nested Data Model}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Easier for ``programmers'' to think of nested data
      structures}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item E.g.: capture information about positional occurrences of
      terms in a collection of documents
    \item \texttt{Map<documnetId, Set<positions> >}
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{Instead, RDBMS allows only fat tables}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Only atomic fields as columns
    \item Require {\color{red}normalization}
    \item From the example above: need to create two tables
    \item \texttt{term\_info: (termId, termString, ...)}
    \item \texttt{position\_info: (termId, documentId, position)}
    \item[$\to$] Occurrence information obtained by joining on
      \texttt{termId}, and grouping on \texttt{termId, documentId}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame {\frametitle{Nested Data Model}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Fully nested data model (see also later in the
      presentation)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Allows complex, non-atomic data types
    \item E.g.: set, map, tuple
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{Advantages of a nested data model}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item More natural than normalization
    \item Data is often already stored in a nested fashion on disk
      \begin{itemize}
      \item E.g.: a web crawler outputs for each crawled url, the set
        of outlinks
      \item Separating this in normalized form imply use of joins,
        which is an overkill for web-scale data
      \end{itemize}
    \item Nested data allows to have an {\color{red}algebraic
        language}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item E.g.: each tuple output by \texttt{GROUP} has one
        non-atomic field, a nested set of tuples from the same group
      \end{itemize}
    \item Nested data makes life easy when writing UDFs
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame {\frametitle{User Defined Functions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Custom processing is often predominant}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item E.g.: users may be interested in performing natural language
      stemming of a search term, or tagging urls as spam
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{All commands of Pig Latin can be customized}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Grouping, filtering, joining, per-tuple processing
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{UDFs support the nested data model}

    \item Only scalar functions can be used in \texttt{SELECT} clauses
    \item Only set-valued functions can appear in the \texttt{FROM}
      clause
    \item Aggregation functions can only be applied to \texttt{GROUP BY} or

\frame {\frametitle{Handling parallel execution}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Pig and Pig Latin are geared towards parallel
      processing}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Of course, the underlying execution engine is MapReduce
    \item SPORK = Pig on Spark $\to$ the execution engine need not be MapReduce

  \item \textbf{Pig Latin primitives are chosen such that they can be
